# Project Module 12 - Introduction to VR Prototyping in Unity

- This repo is used to showcase my maze prototype project built using XR toolkits. These include the Oculus XR Plugin, XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Plugin Management, ProBuilder and ProGrids. XR Controller and XR Ray Cast Interaction was used to maneuver my character from point A to point B. At the same time the XR Grab Interaction was used to grasp items such as the golden key to open the locked door. ProGrids and ProBuilder enables me to design a suitable maze prototype for a top down idea on what my project would look like. My VR prototype features a locked corridor, a golden key, a computer room and a couple of props to give life to the maze. Below you will find screenshots of my entire playground as well as a link to my screencast.

## Unity Technologies

- Oculus XR Plugin: Provides display and input support for Oculus devices.
- ProBuilder: Provides functionality and behavior to build, edit, and texture custom geometry in Unity with the tools available in the ProBuilder package. Advanced features include: UV editing and texture mapping, Vertex Colors application, and parametric creation of shapes.
- ProGrids: Provides grid snapping which keeps objects aligned and evenly spaced. This is an esstential part in most, if not, all level design workflow.
XR Interaction Toolkit: Provides enchanced VR and AR experiences.
- XR Plugin Management: Provides simple management of XR plugins. Manages and offers help with loading, initialization, settings, and build support for XR plugins.
